# Fitness API

This project is a backend API for logging Apple Watch workout sessions and optional activity metrics such as distance and calories.

I built this project to better understand backend development, database design, and how APIs handle real-world data that I personally care about.

The API is built using backend fundamentals and SQL, with endpoints tested using Postman.
