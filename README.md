Backend API for logging workouts and exercise metrics


This project is a backend API for logging workouts and exercise/cardio metrics such as sets, reps, weight, and duration.

I built this to better understand backend development, database design, and how APIs handle real-world data that I personally care about.

The API is built using backend fundamentals and SQL, with endpoints tested using Postman.
